Temporary folder of gif version of figures from "Using AGN lightcurves to map accretion disc temperature fluctuations" - Neustadt &amp; Kochanek, 2022

In our paper, we invert UV/optical lightcurves into a map of temperature fluctuations on the surface of the accretion disc as a function of time and radius.  Due to the nature of the inversion, rather than a given solution, we have a range of solutions that depend on a smoothing parameter xi, which each have a chi^2 goodness-of-fit value associated with it.  The figures in our paper show how the solutions change for a select range of xi values. These gif versions show a more complete range of xi values and show in finer detail how the temperature fluctuation patterns and chi^2 change with increasing (and decreasing) xi.  

See the paper (arxiv link here) for more details.

For each AGN gif, the left plot shows the temperature fluctuation map in the form of a color map.  The color scale is set as the 99th percentile of the range of |dT/T| values.  The right plot shows the chi^2 per data point distribution as a funciton of smoothing parameter xi.  Each frame of the gif corresponds to the solution associated with a given xi value, which is labeled on the right plot.  Also labeled are the chi^2 per data point and the scale of |dT/T| for the colorbars.
