Temporary folder of gif version of figures from "Using AGN lightcurves to map accretion disc temperature fluctuations" - Neustadt &amp; Kochanek, 2022, submitted to MNRAS.

In our paper, we invert AGN UV/optical lightcurves into maps of temperature fluctuations &delta;T on the surface of the accretion disc as a function of time and radius.  Due to the nature of the inversion, rather than a single solution, we have a range of solutions that are dependent on a smoothing parameter &xi;, which each have a &chi;^2 goodness-of-fit value associated with it.  The figures in our paper show how the solutions change for a chosen set of &xi; values. These gif versions show a more complete range of &xi; values and show in finer detail how the temperature fluctuation patterns and &chi;^2 change with increasing (and decreasing) &xi;.  

For each AGN gif, the left plot shows the temperature fluctuation map as a color map.  The color scale is set as the 99th percentile of the range of |&delta;T/T| values, which is printed in the lower left hand corner, as well as the &chi;^2 per data point.  The right plot shows the &chi;^2 distribution as a function of smoothing parameter &xi;.  Each frame of the gif corresponds to the temperature fluctuation map solution associated with a given &xi; value, the value of which is plotted and printed in the right plot.
