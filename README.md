Temporary folder of gif version of figures from "Using AGN lightcurves to map accretion disc temperature fluctuations" - Neustadt &amp; Kochanek, 2022

In our paper, we invert UV/optical lightcurves into a map of temperature fluctuations on the surface of the accretion disc as a function of time and radius.  
Due to the nature of the inversion, rather than a given solution, we have a range of solutions that depend on a smoothing parameter xi,
which each have a chi^2 goodness-of-fit value associated with it.  
The figures in our paper show how the solutions change for a range of xi values.
These gif versions show in finer detail how the fluctuation patterns and chi^2 change as xi is increased (and decreased).
See the paper (arxiv link here) for more details.

Each inversion gives the chi^2 per data point and the scale of |dT/T| for the colorbars.
The color scale is set as the 99th percentile of the range of |dT/T| values.
